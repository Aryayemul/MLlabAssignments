# Career Guidance Chatbot

An AI-powered career guidance assistant with job search capabilities, career exploration, and personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **AI-powered Career Guidance**: Get intelligent responses to career-related questions
- **LinkedIn Job Search**: Find and explore current job listings on LinkedIn
- **Career Explorer**: Browse information about various careers including responsibilities, skills, and educational requirements
- **Salary Information**: Get estimates for different job roles and experience levels
- **Multi-turn Memory**: The chatbot remembers your conversation context for more natural interactions

## Project Structure

- `CareerGuidance.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the career guidance application
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for running the application
- `/data`: Directory containing career information and datasets
- `/eda_results` & `/eda_plots`: Exploratory data analysis results and visualizations
- `/model_evaluation_results`: Performance metrics and model evaluation data

## Technical Implementation

### Chatbot Architecture
- **LlamaIndex Framework**: Used for document indexing, retrieval, and context management
- **Conversational Memory**: Implemented using a deque with fixed-length history to maintain context
- **Query Engine**: Processes user inputs and generates contextually relevant responses
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Gracefully handles edge cases when the primary model cannot provide a response

### NLP Models & Methods
- **HuggingFace Transformers**: Leverages pre-trained language models for natural language understanding
- **Sentence Transformers**: Used for semantic search and semantic similarity scoring
- **Vector Store Index**: Creates embeddings of career information for efficient retrieval
- **Few-shot Learning**: Implements examples in prompts to guide model responses for specific query types

### Data Processing
- **BeautifulSoup**: Scrapes and parses LinkedIn job listings in real-time
- **Regular Expressions**: Detects query types and extracts key information from user inputs
- **NLTK**: Used for text preprocessing, tokenization, and basic NLP tasks

### Career Information Retrieval
- **Document Storage**: Career information stored as structured text files
- **Semantic Search**: Matches user queries to relevant career information based on meaning
- **Context-aware Responses**: Generates responses that incorporate both the query and retrieved information

## Technologies Used

- **LlamaIndex**: Document indexing and retrieval
- **HuggingFace Transformers**: NLP models and tokenizers
- **BeautifulSoup**: For scraping job listings
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model development

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To launch the Career Guidance Chatbot:

```
python nlp_salary_predictor.py
jupyter notebook CareerGuidance.ipynb

```

Then run all cells in the notebook to start the application.

## Usage

1. **Chat Interface**: Ask any career-related question in the chat
2. **Job Search**: Use the job search feature to find current LinkedIn job listings
3. **Salary Information**: Ask about salary ranges for specific roles and experience levels

## Salary Prediction

The application includes basic salary prediction functionality for different job roles and experience levels. The implementation:
- Extracts job roles and experience levels from natural language queries
- Maps experience descriptions to standardized levels (Entry, Mid, Senior)
- Provides estimated salary ranges based on role and experience

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- 4GB+ RAM (8GB+ recommended for optimal performance)
- Internet connection (for job listings and initial model downloads)

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter memory issues, try closing other applications
- For model loading errors, ensure you have a stable internet connection
- If web scraping features aren't working, check your network connection or LinkedIn's accessibility
